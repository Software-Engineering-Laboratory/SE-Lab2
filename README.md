# SE-Lab2
This code is implemented as a solution for the 2nd experiment of CE40404(Software Engineering Lab), Fall 2021 at Sharif University of Technology. This experiment is mainly about **Behavior Driven Development (BDD)** and working with software tools like **Cucumber**. As a sample, a calculator is implemented which is able to compute the addition of two numbers, reverse and square root of a given integer.
